Kia ora koutou, thanks for taking the time to learn a bit about me.

I’m a student secondary school teacher living in Tāmaki Makaurau – Auckland, with my family. We returned to Aotearoa in January 2020 after 13 years in the UK, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore. While overseas, I worked in the broadcast industry and also completed my Bachelor of Business with a major in international business through Massey University via distance learning.

My time in the media in NZ and abroad provided unique experiences of how commerce and society are intertwined. I have always been very passionate about creating an inclusive culture and providing opportunities for everyone to participate and excel. It has motivated me to follow a path of helping the next generation understand how their place in the world will shape the society of the future.
