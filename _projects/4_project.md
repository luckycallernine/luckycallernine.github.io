### Goal Development ###

Looking at my practicum goals sheet in the context of where I am currently with my time at Papatoetoe I feel that certainly set my targets at the right level and in the right areas. I think I was unprepared for just how much energy and maintained focus is required in a classroom environment. In the first week and in this second I am feeling the effort involved, however I am starting to settle into the routine and this is helping. One area that has not panned out as planned is getting in front of a class to lead a lesson. My first scheduled lesson was unfortunately removed due to the international cultural day and there has not been any openings in this second week to place in any other earlier opportunities. While in one way I am not overly concerned as I am getting plenty of interaction and one on one time with students I am also aware that this loads a lot of my actual class time towards the last half of my practicum. That aside I feel that I am trying on a daily basis to ensure I keep my goals in mind as I approach each class and spend time on campus.

### Reflection ###

I am a little sad that my last couple of days at Papatoetoe were disrupted and that I didn't get the chance to close out my last lessons and also finish up with my AT and colleagues. However, I guess this is an example of the need to balance life in and out of work and how sometimes one has to come ahead over the other. Looking at each of my goals individually I can already see room for improvement and areas I need to consider as I continue my journey into teaching.

1. While I did endeavour to bring an understanding of Te Tiriti into my lessons and interactions I did feel that I have a sizeable amount of learning to do in this area to ensure that I am well versed enough in what I am attempting to give it the respect it deserves. I was grateful that I was in a school that has begun a strong change in the way they approach teaching through the lens of Te Tiriti and which is actioned through there Rongohia te hau undertaking. For my next steps I need to go deeper and learn more about this and culturally responsive and relational pedagogy.
2. For this I felt that I did well in become part of the school environment and integrating/interacting with both staff and ākonga. I really enjoyed the camaraderie of the department and starting to create relationships with students. I was surprised to how quickly you begin to bond and relate to the ākonga you meet each day. I am already thinking of how I will miss quite a few of them and how they may have changed when I return in September. Overall I am pleased with this goal and felt I did meet it. While in the future I need to extend my connections across the faculty and continue to integrate myself in the wider school and community.
3. As I mentioned in my reflections, this was one of the most demanding parts of my time. I think due in part to my approach of taking each lesson in silo and not perhaps appreciating the need to link the learning together in a cohesive stream through the subject. While I did feel confident in presenting lesson and being in the classroom environment it was noticeable that my pacing and ability to have a lesson flow was not as I expected. One of my AT's noting that in a particular early lesson I fell a bit short of filling the time and was unable to bridge this gap without assistance. I have included two lesson plans below, the first being the one that I was caught short in.
	 

What I think this illustrates is it is not necessarily the amount of content that you plan out for a lesson but how you approach and cover it. While I don't feel unhappy about my planning I  know that this is a skill I will need to work on along with spending more time in front of a class to continue to gain confidence.
