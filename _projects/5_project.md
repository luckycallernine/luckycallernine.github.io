### First Impressions ###

Arriving on my first day, ironically, the first person I encountered was the school principle as I was walking my bike in through the gates. He helpfully directed me to a good spot to lock it up and we had a brief conversation about practicum and how I had come to be at Papatoetoe. I then waited for my AT to arrive and they escorted me to the staff room and the Monday staff meeting that followed. The rest of the day is a bit of a blur to be honest. It has been probably 25+ years since I was at a high school and just the sheer number of students and staff was quite overwhelming. Along with that there was the difference in the ākonga themselves, they all seemed so much more mature than I thought of myself at high school. Beards, tattoos, false nails and cellphones all at the fore and not something I remembered from my time at secondary. However, it was all really energising and exciting and the school had a real "buzzy" vibe with great energy. There was also a real sense of identity with the students especially given the very challenging times that they had recently not only as a school but a community.

### Final Reflections ###

Thinking back over my past four weeks at Papaptoetoe I still feel that a lot of my first impression have remained valid. It is not that anything I observed on those first couple of days has changed, but more that my depth of understanding in the environment has grown. Along with this I have begun to gain a better grasp of the many moving parts and nuances that all come together on any given day in an education setting. A school really does feel like a huge extended family and like any whanau there are days when people are going well and days when people are not. This school is not without its share of challenges and there are certainly aspects that are sadly not helping either the ākonga or Kaiako. However, as I felt on my first day, there is an energy and vibe that permeates the school and this translates on the whole to a positive outlook for the majority of those who spend there time here, myself included.
